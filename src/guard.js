// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Plausibility of the lifetime counters (kWh) before they reach Gladys. Pure.
// Taken as is from gladys-p1-monitor (src/guard.js, approved for the billed
// index), only its constants changed (a Solakon ONE moves 2.4 kW at most).
//
// The core turns the deltas of an index feature into energy: it skips a
// delta below zero (a counter reset) but counts every rise IN FULL. The rules:
// - a value of 0 (or below) is never published;
// - a value plausible after the last one published (not lower, not more than
//   COUNTER_MAX_KW on average since then) goes through; a value EQUAL to it
//   goes through without moving its date;
// - a drop and a jump up are NEVER confirmed by repetition nor by time: they
//   are held (nothing published), shown in the status, kept in /data across
//   restarts, and taken only on an explicit gesture of the user (the "Accept
//   the held counters" action, two presses);
// - the acceptance is BOUNDED: it covers the value shown (`held.to`, read at
//   `held.at`) and what the device may have moved since (COUNTER_MAX_KW x
//   hours + COUNTER_SLACK_KWH), nothing else;
// - an accepted value is a floor both ways: a value under it is held (never
//   counted), the acceptance kept and its margin counted from then;
// - while a jump is held, every value at or above it stays held;
// - a value back to the usual rule ends the hold, but only within the margin
//   counted from the hold itself.
// Times are wall times (the dates of Gladys and /data), never a decision on
// a guard of a command.
